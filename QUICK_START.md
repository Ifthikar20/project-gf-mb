# Quick Setup Instructions

## You're almost there! Just a few more steps:

### Current Status:
✅ Flutter installed (3.38.5)
✅ Project dependencies downloaded  
✅ Code generated
✅ Web support enabled
✅ Asset folders created
⚠️ Fixing compatibility issues...

### To Run on Web (No Xcode Needed):

Once I fix the last few errors, you'll run:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Your app will open in Chrome browser!

### To Deploy to Your iPhone (Requires Xcode):

Unfortunately, to deploy to a physical iPhone, you **must** install Xcode. There's no way around it because:
- Apple requires their build tools
- These only come with Xcode (~15-20 GB)

**Alternative for iPhone Testing:**
- Use a cloud building service (Codemagic, Bitrise)
- Or install Xcode just for building

### My Recommendation:
**Test on web first** - it works perfectly for development and you can see all features without the 20GB Xcode download!
